This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project

## Getting Started

Hi i'm Bryce.

This is my personal Website. Its likely a work in progress when you land on this page. Hopeing to be able to have multiple webpages/mini apps that I will use on a daily basis. 

I had an old website : bstocksharp.github.io but sadly i only pushed the build to production and lost the code. Learned my lesson and will be keeping all code on github for this project.

## Calendar
Will start as a way to display the dinner items my wife and I will have over the next 2 weeks so i don't ask "what's for dinner" every day.
Next to impliment will be a way to display tasks due on a certain date (ie : send email to X by Friday) 
Next to impliment will be recurring tasks (ie : trash every tuesday)
Hopefulyl will have a way to display this in a clean and easy manner to add new tasks/events.


## Puzzle a Day
This app will be puzzle where the only squares left showing are the Month and the Day, so every day you have to complete the puzzle.
Difficulty as i have never dealt with draggable divs. 
Also hoping to not have to upload complete sets for each day...
