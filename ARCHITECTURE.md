# Architecture

A personal **hub of small apps** — one Next.js site whose root is a launcher, with
each app living under `app/<slug>`. Today: **Garage** (cars / the Miata build) and
**Workout** (a phone-first exercise companion). Everything is *public to view,
password to edit*.

## Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router — React Server Components + Server Actions)
- **React 19**, **TypeScript** (strict)
- **MUI v7** with Emotion and a CSS-variable theme (no Tailwind)
- **Drizzle ORM** on **Neon Postgres** (serverless HTTP driver)
- Deployed on **Vercel**
- No client state library — server state is the DB (RSC reads + Server Actions);
  local UI state is plain React hooks.

```

## Adding a new app (the recipe)

1. **Register it:** add one `AppDef` to [`lib/apps.tsx`](lib/apps.tsx) — including
   its in-app `nav` links. This alone lights it up in the hub grid
   ([`app/page.tsx`](app/page.tsx)) and drives the header + `AppSwitcher`.
2. **Create the route folder** `app/<slug>/`: `layout.tsx` (just
   `<AppShell current="<slug>">{children}</AppShell>` — nav, hidden-apps, the
   account menu, appearance, and the editing lock are all resolved inside
   `AppShell`, so there's nothing else to wire), `error.tsx` (copy garage's),
   `page.tsx`.
3. **If it needs data:** add tables to `lib/db/schema.ts` → `npm run db:push`; write
   reads in `lib/queries/<domain>.ts` (`import "server-only"`) and writes in
   `app/actions/<domain>.ts` (`"use server"`, each guarded by `requireEditor()`).
4. **Components** go in `components/<slug>/`; only cross-app/generic ones go in
   `components/shared/`.

## Auth — public to view, password to edit

[`lib/auth.ts`](lib/auth.ts): there are no user accounts. A single shared
`EDIT_PASSWORD` unlocks editing for everyone; the cookie value is an HMAC of
`"editor"` keyed by `COOKIE_SECRET` (unforgeable). `isEditor()` gates UI; every
mutating action calls `requireEditor()`. Missing secrets degrade to read-only
(never crash). Unlock at `/unlock`. **Editing is the *only* real security
boundary** — see Profiles below for why profile scoping is organization, not auth.

## Profiles, visibility & access

**Profiles are hub-wide "who's using it" identities** (the `profiles` table — Bryce,
Lauren), not accounts. The active profile is a persisted preference (`active_profile`
cookie — [`lib/profile.ts`](lib/profile.ts) `getActiveProfile()`, precedence:
`?profile` override → cookie → first profile). The header shows and switches it
([`ProfileControl`](components/shared/ProfileControl.tsx) →
[`ProfileMenu`](components/shared/ProfileMenu.tsx)); unlocked editors can add people.
It renders in every app header, so identity is consistent hub-wide.

**Profiles are NOT a security boundary (by design).** There are no per-profile
passwords and anyone may switch profiles freely — so profile-level "permissions"
would be unenforceable theater. The only real gate is the site-wide `EDIT_PASSWORD`.
Two consequences:

- **Visibility = organization, not permission.** A vehicle has an **owner**
  (`vehicles.profile_id`) and a **visibility** (`vehicles.visibility`: `shared` |
  `private`, default `shared`). The garage grid/dashboard shows
  `visibility = 'shared' OR owner = active profile`. Everything hanging off a vehicle
  (maintenance, fuel, parts, builds, wishlist, journal) inherits that scope;
  `resources` and `checklists` stay shared. A shared car (e.g. a household RAV4) shows
  for everyone and any unlocked editor can log to it; a private car shows only in its
  owner's garage.
- **Editing stays gated by the one site password**, regardless of profile — any
  unlocked person can edit any car they can see.

**Lifecycle:** editors add people (profile menu → *Add person*) and manage them at
**`/people`** (linked from the switcher). *Deactivate* soft-deletes
(`profiles.archived_at`) — hidden from the switcher, can't be active, **all data
kept**; *Reactivate* restores. *Delete forever* is irreversible: it reassigns the
person's **shared** cars + authored workouts to a chosen **heir**, then deletes their
**private** cars (cascading that history) and their weekly schedule. Guards: can't
deactivate the last active profile or delete without an heir, and
`workouts.createdByProfileId` is `ON DELETE RESTRICT` so a delete can never nuke
shared routines out from under someone.

**Future direction:** if this grows into a multi-tenant product, an **account login**
becomes the real security boundary with profiles living *under* an account.
`visibility` then grows a `custom` value backed by a `vehicle_shares` join table
(vehicleId, profileId, canEdit) — no rework of the owner/visibility columns.
Per-profile passwords are intentionally omitted (a profile wanting true privacy = its
own account); revisit only if that product direction changes.

## Data layer

- **Client:** [`lib/db/index.ts`](lib/db/index.ts) — one Drizzle instance over the
  Neon HTTP driver, server-only.
- **Schema:** [`lib/db/schema.ts`](lib/db/schema.ts) — one file, `serial` PKs,
  `varchar` status/category/section fields documented inline (not PG enums — kept
  flexible), `$inferSelect`/`$inferInsert` types exported per table.
- **Reads:** `lib/queries/*.ts`, called directly inside Server Components (no HTTP
  round-trip).
- **Writes:** `app/actions/*.ts` — `requireEditor()` → parse `FormData` → Drizzle
  write → `revalidatePath(...)` (→ `redirect(...)` for one-shot forms). **Auto-save
  editors** (workout builder, schedule) submit on blur/change and *revalidate in
  place* (no redirect, no scroll jump).
- **Migrations:** `npm run db:push` (drizzle-kit push — no versioned migration
  files). `npm run db:studio` to browse. Seed with `node scripts/seed-workout.mjs`
  (`--reset` wipes and reseeds).

## The Workout app

**Tables** (all in `schema.ts`):

- `profiles` — the hub-wide people (Bryce, Lauren). Profiles are *data*, not accounts;
  see **Profiles, visibility & access** above.
- `exercises` — the **shared catalog** with recommended defaults (`defaultReps`,
  `defaultDuration`, `defaultWeight`, `holdLast`, `description`, `tips`).
- `workouts` — a **shared library** of routines. `createdByProfileId` is just
  "saved by" (any unlocked editor can edit any workout). A workout has three
  sections; **MAIN is a circuit** rotated `rounds` times; `restBetweenRounds`
  controls the rest between rounds.
- `workout_items` — ordered exercises in a workout, tagged with `section`
  (warmup | main | cooldown). Per-item overrides (`reps`, `duration`, `weight`,
  `holdLast`) fall back to the exercise when null.
- `workout_assignments` — **per-profile scheduling**: `(profileId, weekday) →
  workoutId`, unique per profile+weekday. A workout can be reused across days and
  profiles.

**Derived model** ([`lib/workout.ts`](lib/workout.ts)): an item's *mode* isn't
stored — **reps present → rep-based; otherwise timed**. `duration` means *per-rep
seconds* when reps are set (auto mode times each rep), else *total hold*.
`resolveItem()` merges an item with its exercise into a `ResolvedItem` that both the
builder and the runner consume.

**Key screens:**

- **Dashboard** (`app/workout/page.tsx`) — profile switcher, today's workout + this
  profile's week ([`WeekSchedule`](components/workout/WeekSchedule.tsx), uses the
  phone's clock), and the shared library.
- **Builder** (`app/workout/[id]/edit`) — **fully auto-save** (no Save buttons):
  meta saves on blur, items add-on-select and edit inline (accordion), reorder/remove
  are instant.
- **Schedule** (`app/workout/schedule`) — per-profile weekday → workout, auto-saved.
- **Day view** (`app/workout/day/[weekday]`) — see/setup any day (incl. rest days).
- **The runner** (`app/workout/[id]/run` + [`WorkoutRunner`](components/workout/WorkoutRunner.tsx)):
  `buildSteps()` expands **warmup (once) → main (× rounds) → cooldown (once)** with a
  10-second "Get ready" prep between exercises and a rest between rounds. The dial:
  *timed* = a depleting clock ring; *reps with a per-rep time* = a **breathing inner
  disc** that peaks at the midpoint with the rep count; *manual reps* = big target +
  "Done → Next". **Hold-last-rep** doubles the final rep (build → HOLD at the top →
  fall). Auto-advance toggle, WebAudio beep + colour flash + vibrate at zero, screen
  wake-lock, random rotating tip + ⓘ description.

## Conventions

- **One chip style, from the theme** — MUI `Chip` is styled globally in
  [`app/theme.ts`](app/theme.ts) (`MuiChip`) as a compact outlined pill, so every
  chip (targets, rounds, "saved by", categories, profile labels, statuses) is
  consistent. Use plain `Chip`; pass `variant="filled"` / `size="medium"` to opt out.
- RSC by default; `"use client"` only where there's interactivity.
- Auto-save editors submit on change (no Save/Cancel); one-shot create forms keep an
  explicit submit.

## Dev & deploy

- `npm run dev` · `npm run db:push` · `npm run db:studio` · `node scripts/seed-workout.mjs`
- **Env** (`.env.local`, gitignored): `POSTGRES_URL` / `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`
  (Neon, auto from the Vercel integration), `COOKIE_SECRET` + `EDIT_PASSWORD`
  (editor auth). ⚠️ The auth vars are **local-only today** — add them in Vercel →
  Environment Variables for editing to work on the deployed site (viewing/running
  works without).
- **PWA:** the hub is installable ("Add to Home Screen") and runs standalone via
  `app/manifest.ts` + `public/icon.svg` + `app/apple-icon.tsx`.
